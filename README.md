# Image Segmentation with U-Net Architecture

## Project Description

This project demonstrates the use of the U-Net architecture for image segmentation tasks. Image segmentation is a computer vision technique that involves partitioning an image into multiple segments or regions to simplify analysis. U-Net is a popular architecture for semantic segmentation, medical image analysis, and various other image segmentation applications.

In this project, we implement the U-Net architecture using [framework/library name] and provide an example of how to perform image segmentation on a sample dataset.
